Project Brainstorm Homework: 

Interests/ hobbies & potential ideas:

* Plant-based cooking & veganism: I could do something here but I think it's way overdone

* Mental health / ADHD / meditation: There are many mental health apps out there. I don't know if one like this exists, but a web app to search for ad-free mind calming tools: guided meditations, asmr videos/sounds, frequency/sound bath videos/sounds , sleep or audio stories,  games, etc. Maybe a spot to journal and also house favorited tools, hydration reminders, etc

* Disc golf: Tee time buddy finder for disc golf. Many folks love the game but don't want to spend hours playing weekly's or going solo. Match-making app to find golf friends / card mates. The filters can be things like calendar blocks , location, skill level, drug/alcohol/tobacco preferences, friendly or stakes game, dog/kid friendly, men/women/all genders etc. You can look at their profiles to like someone and make a match.  Lol, basically a facebook/tinder for frolfers with the potential to expand to ball golf, and maybe other sports. I don't think this app exists as I know a for a fact folks are still trying to find frolf buddies on facebook and some frolfers have asked for someone to make this app on Reddit.
